## This extension is a programmer's best friend

It's your 10th time searching how to vertically align a div in CSS, and you're clicking the same forum post or w3 school link for the 100th time. We've all been there...

I'm sure that most programmers have used w3 school or stack overflow to quickly find the answers to any programming question.

I want to show you an extension I use in addition to w3 school and stack overflow that allows me to quickly find the answer to any technical problem I encounter.

## [Grepper](https://www.codegrepper.com/)

Grepper is a Google Chrome extension that shows the top-rated answer by thousands of developers every time you put a question into Google. 

It is a community-driven platform so you can contribute as well as see answers from other developers.

For example, if you are wondering how to center a div, this is what comes up in your Google search above any links to pages or blogs.

This allows you to easily browse multiple alternatives and answers by other developers without having to browse multiple different stack overflow pages to find the same exact answer.

## How to use Grepper

All you have to do to get started with Grepper is make an account and install the Google Chrome extension.[Here is a link to the chrome web store download page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grepper/amaaokahonnfjjemodnpmeenfpnnbkco).

Once you have your account all you have to do is use Google as you normally would and answers from developers will show up at the top of the Google search results.

If you want to contribute you can go to the [answer page](https://www.codegrepper.com/app/answer.php) and answer questions that other developers have searched in google, but do not have any submissions yet. By doing this you can help the community and earn points while doing so!

There are belts that you can earn as you answer questions. You can improve your belt by writing answers that are read by other people. Currently, I am a brown belt at the time of writing this post and I have helped 66004 Developers find answers to 117464 problems.

## Why you should use Grepper

By using Grepper there have been multiple times that I found answers to my questions without having to dig through different pages. I think that alone is enough for developers to at least give it a shot. I am not affiliated at all with Grepper. I think it is a great tool that developers should have in their pockets.

You can also earn points that you can redeem for NFTs. I am not very into crypto, but it is another gamification of the coding process that can make it enjoyable to use. 

Grepper can also help progress your career. It's possible that a recruiter or software engineer sees your answer and connects with you. Having more reach is always beneficial. You never know who sees your answers and the power of serendipity.
